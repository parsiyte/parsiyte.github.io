PARS (Parallel Systems) Research Group is led by Assistant Professor Işıl Öz. We are part of [Computer Engineering Department](https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr) at [IZTECH](https://www.iyte.edu.tr).

Our group focuses on various issues:

- Multicore/GPU architectures
- Performance and reliability analysis of parallel systems
- Parallel software development
- Parallel programming models

We are always looking for motivated students interested in related topics. Please feel free to email [Işıl](mailto:isiloz@iyte.edu.tr)!
